    <h2>White Water  <span class= "color-acento"> Rafting </span></h2>
    <p>
The Cangrejal River in Honduras is the perfect setting for an adventurous activity like White River Rafting. 
The river's banks border the Pico Bonito National Park on one side and the Nombre de Dios National Park on the 
other. As the river's waters originate in the beautiful and rugged Nombre de Dios mountain range, it also has a 
steep gradient. This speeds up the water on its way towards the Caribbean Sea. Furthermore the particular geology 
of the area has produced huge rocks sometimes even of the size of a house. These are scattered in the riverbed 
and form small waterfalls and rapids that are ideal for this activity. The most common is the section downstream 
from the municipality of El Naranjo, which consists of class III-IV rapids. This is the most popular section of
the river and offers a lot of excitement. It triggers a high level of adrenaline in participants, yet is so safe 
that no previous experience is required.

We offer daily rafting tours at 9:30 am and 1:00 pm for a minimum of two people. If you are traveling alone,
 still make a request as other people may have already signed up for the tour. We will meet at our place at 
 Jungle River Lodge to get ready with our equipment. Then we will drive a short distance in our funky jeep 
 to the first spot. We do a rafting tour in the safer area with class III rapids starting in the area of 
 El Naranjo. At the beginning you will climb and swim through the local favored Cangrajal River to get to 
 the starting point of the rafting. Thereafter, you will start the White River Rafting. The tour lasts 2-3 hours 
 in total. Our local guide speaks Spanish and English.

        We are River Lodge, one of the few backpacker-friendly lodges located between two of the largest and most diverse national parks in Honduras. Unlike most local accommodations, we are located directly on the Rio Cangrejal. The rustic character of the lodge gives it a cozy and homely atmosphere inspired by the surrounding jungle.
        Whether you want to relax and enjoy doing nothing, watch wildlife, or embark on a jungle adventure, Jungle River Lodge will provide you with an unforgettable experience.
